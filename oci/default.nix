  /* Creates an OCI layer

     entries is an attrset describing files to create / copy into the layer.
     The attrset name will be the path of the entry, and the value is an
     attrset describing it.

     The entry attrset MUST have a type which is one of "file", "directory" or
     "link". "mode", "uid", "gid" may also be specified to change the file
     attributes where applicable.

     File entries may have either a text attr which writes the contents as is
     to the file, or a source attr which specifies a path to copy from.
     Directory entries can have a sources attr which is a list of paths to copy
     from. Each source is an attrset containing a path and uid, gid, and mode
     specifier (0755, +w, etc). Link entries must have a target attr specifying
     where to link to.

     umask specifies the "umask" to be applied to entries by default.

     path is a list of derivations to add to the PATH of the resulting image
     containing this layer.

     includes is a list of derivations to include into the layer's nix store.
     This is mostly useful for putting less frequently changing dependencies
     earlier in the layer list.

     excludes is a list of derivations whose closure should be excluded from
     the layer (in the case where those derivations are already included in an
     earlier layer).
